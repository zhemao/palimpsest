# Palimpsest

Palimpsest is an experimental HTML5 Canvas-based drawing application.
It is written in Clojurescript.

It is currently rather bare-bones, with support for simple pencil lines
of variable thickness and basic undo/redo functionality.

## Using the application

In the project directory, run `lein cljsbuild once`, then open up the
`dev-resources/public/index.html` file.
